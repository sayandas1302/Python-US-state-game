# Python-US-state-game
This is a simple game to memorize the name of the 50 states of United States of America. It uses Pandas and turtle to create a UI that takes the guess of the state name and plot a correct guess into an US map. It also list out the name of the states that the user misses.

### Getting Started
1. Download the entire project folder and create an environment inside the folder
2. Next in the cmd prompt activate the created environment and use the commandline 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to install all the required module in the environment
3. Once all the installation is done click on the app.py folder to run the game. Also you can run the file by using commandline 'python app.py' in the keepin the created virtual environment activated.
4. It will open on a window showing the map of US and asking names of the state in a text input box. Just type the state name and click on 'OK'. If you guessed it correctly then it should show up on the map. In this point, you have put the state name without any spelling mistake, you may spaces where required and you dont have to worry about the upper or lower case. 
5. Once you've guessed all the state names you could guess, type 'exit' into the text input box. Then you should open the 'States_to_learn.csv' folder that singled out all the state names that you had missed out.
6. Enjoy the game!
